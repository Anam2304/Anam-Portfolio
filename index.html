        <h3>Hire me as a Jr. Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
          A junior web developer creates and maintains websites by writing code,
          troubleshooting and revising code. After a web designer creates a
          concept for a website's appearance and operation, the web developer
          transforms that design into a working site. A junior web developer
          works on a team with more senior developers to get professional
          experience in web development and learn from their expertise.
